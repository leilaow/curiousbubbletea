For fellow bubble tea addicts

# What I did
using cs50finance as a template, i edited it to create a virtual bubble tea diary
users can register for an account and store their personal bubble tea ratings
ratings are based on five criterias: chewiness of the pearls, milkiness, taste of tea, concentration, and whether its value for money
on users next bubble tea trip, they can just check back and see which bubble teabest suit their craving... chewy pearls? or extra milkiness?

# For future reference
moving on, it might be great to have user's information on bubble tea ratings to be made public so other bubble tea lovers can peruse them
